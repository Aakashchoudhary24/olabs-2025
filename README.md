# LabNav - AI-Powered Search for Virtual Labs

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of **OLabs Hackathon 2025 (OLabsThon)**, a national-level technology event organized by **Amrita School of Computing, ACM Student Chapter, and Amrita CREATE**. The project aims to enhance **OLabs**, an online virtual laboratory initiative, by integrating an **AI-powered search system** for improved accessibility and resource discovery.

## 🎯 Objective
Our goal was to create an **intelligent search functionality** that helps students easily find and relate educational resources, experiment manuals, and relevant study materials.

### Why?
- ✨ **Bridging the gap:** Many students in rural areas lack access to physical labs.
- ✨ **Enhancing e-learning:** AI-powered search improves student engagement, memory retention, and independent learning.
- ✨ **Making OLabs a self-study tool:** Enabling seamless access to study materials with intelligent recommendations.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **AI-Powered Search:** Finds and suggests relevant resources from experiment manuals and academic materials.
- ✅ **PDF Processing:** Extracts text from PDFs and indexes it for efficient search.
- ✅ **Semantic Search with TensorFlow:** Uses NLP-based embeddings for smart document retrieval.
- ✅ **Scalable Web Application:** Built with **Next.js** for a modern and responsive UI.
- ✅ **Backend with Python & Flask:** Manages search indexing and data retrieval.
- ✅ **User-Friendly Interface:** Categorized **subject-wise search results**.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
### **Frontend**
- **Next.js** (React framework) for building the user interface.
- **CSS** for styling.

### **Backend**
- **Flask** for API development.
- **Python** for processing PDFs and search functionalities.
- **TensorFlow** for **embedding-based** semantic search.
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation
### 1️⃣ Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3️⃣ Access the Web Application
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🔗 Future Scope
- **Integration with OLabs:** Embedding the AI-powered search feature into the official OLabs platform.
- **Advanced AI Suggestions:** Implementing GPT-based recommendations for study pathways.
- **Blockchain Credentials:** Secure verification of experiment completion.

## 👥 Team & Credits
This project was developed by a team of passionate developers during **OLabsThon 2025**. Special thanks to **Amrita CREATE, ACM Student Chapter, and OLabs Hackathon organizers** for the opportunity.
